Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

***Note: this would be to check if a AVL tree is balanced. There are other such trees that have a looser definition of blanced (oppose to the
height differ no more then 1). An AVL would be used in a place like a database where you have large amounts of data and want a stricter balanced
tree so that search time is quicker. A Red Black tree is used in many C++ libraries and libraries in the LINUX kernel
