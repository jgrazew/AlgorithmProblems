Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example:

Input: "{[]}"
Output: true



Imagine you are writing a small compiler for your college project and one of the tasks (or say sub-tasks) for the compiler would be to detect if the parenthesis are in place or not.

The algorithm we will look at in this article can be then used to process all the parenthesis in the program your compiler is compiling and checking if all the parenthesis are in place. This makes checking if a given string of parenthesis is valid or not, an important programming problem.

Algorithm

Initialize a stack S.
Process each bracket of the expression one at a time.
If we encounter an opening bracket, we simply push it onto the stack. This means we will process it later, let us simply move onto the sub-expression ahead.
If we encounter a closing bracket, then we check the element on top of the stack. If the element at the top of the stack is an opening bracket of the same type, then we pop it off the stack and continue processing. Else, this implies an invalid expression.
In the end, if we are left with a stack still having elements, then this implies an invalid expression.
